> In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'

### Tips to understand other's code bases:
- Try to read the code without running it. Start broad before drilling down into specific functions.
- Think about how the code might be implemented.
- Run the code and interact with it to see how it behaves.
- "Poke" at the program by making modifications.
- Get a sense for the vocabulary, making note of anything unfamilar. Try to avoid research unless absolutely necessary.
- Add notes and document confusing areas until a section starts to come into focus.
- Take a historian's view. What was the project like at various stages and how did it evolve? Git can be useful here so that you can see exactly what the code was like at various points in time.
- Read the documentation, but only as much as you need.

It can be helpful to think of two buckets: bucket A is the set of things you're focusing on, and bucket B is the set of things you're explicitly ignoring. The larger the codebase, the more likely that B dwarfs A in size.
