A failed quiz attempt is a sign of some underlying misconception or process issue. The objective of our quiz system is to surface these issues, so that you can correct them. Over time, this will allow you to systematically transform weaknesses into strengths. Here are some useful tips:

- Play devil's advocate against yourself. Ask questions like, "how did I go wrong?" or "what could I have missed?" You'll often hear us use the phrase "adversarial thinking". Similar concept.
- List every assumption you've made, and then ask yourself if you've missed any. Afterwards, aggressively question each one.
- Carefully prove or disprove every single answer choice. This is the only way to identify ALL the correct choices rather than just some.
- Attention-to-detail is an essential skill for effective programming. Our quizzes are no different. For example, you may have to examine your code _character-by-character_. Do what's necessary and rise to the challenge.
- Ask yourself, am I making a mistake I've made before? Tendencies lead people to make similar mistakes, so there's a good chance you may be reoffending. History will repeat itself... unless you learn from it.
- If you've truly done everything in your power and are still stuck, send a well-structured, specific question to team@watchandcode.com and we'll be happy to help.

From reflecting on my life, I've learned that how I deal with intellectual discomfort can be a source of great strength, or a crushing ceiling. Sometimes, I like to close my eyes and imagine two versions of myself.

- Long-term Gordon gets every quiz right on his first attempt. He feels frustration. His shoulders tense up. His breathing shallows. Despite this, he adheres to a methodical process, and slowly chips away until a clear picture emerges out of chaos and uncertainty.
- And then there's short-term Gordon. He's consumed by the immediate frustration. Sometimes he does the right thing. But just as often, he devolves into random guessing and hunches. This provides immediate relief, but long-term stress, because _nothing_ productive can come from it.

Learning effectively is a constant battle between these two versions of myself. It's also an important reminder that when it comes to hard things, the mind game is often harder than the technical one. But it is a necessary one to master if we are to get the most out of ourselves. #goodadvice
