For each assessment, you must include:
- a 1-2 sentence summary of your approach to the problem. If there are multiple functions, each should get its own summary
- A top-down outline that includes FoundationScript and is executable

Grading: For form and correctness you will receive a "Pass", "Fail", or "Not Applicable". For design, you'll receive a letter grade. For solutions that have serious design issues, or that fail to incorporate previous feedback, it is also possible to fail on design. You must pass on all 3 categories in order to move on. For each category, you'll get a “Not-Applicable” mark if you failed any of the preceding categories.
- Form
	- executable with only foundation script
	- summary as above
	- include comments for every block which describe the *broader goal* of your code. Follow the guidelines in [[0-Problem Solving Guide]]
	- every comment must be true
- Correctness: must pass on all valid inputs
- Design: the clarity and simplicity of your approach, as well as the quality and readability of your implementation and comments
