## [Fundamentals] Even 2
Two functions: 

**Function 1**: `evenCount`
The first function, `evenCount`, should take an array of integers as input and return the number of elements in that array that are even.
**example**
`evenCount([2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `2`.

3. [[Choose a strategy based on your criteria]]
- 
4. [[Create a top-down outline of your strategy]]
- 
5. [[Implementation]]
```javascript

```

**Function 2**: `firstEvens`
The second function, `firstEvens` should take an integer (`n`) as input and return an array filled with the first `n` positive even numbers.
**example**
`firstEvens(3)` should return `[2, 4, 6]`
