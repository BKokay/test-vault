1. Imagine that you want to solve the problem *without* a computer. If you devise a solution, what is the underlying technique?
2. Draw. Use pen and paper so there is more freedom to express the problem
3. Use specific examples to make the problem concrete
4. How can one metaphorically hold the problem in our hand and inspect it from every possible angle? 
5. Observation/Discovery cycle: What are all the observations you can make about the problem at various points? If you have to handle various situations, what must be true in each situation? 
6. Decompose - is it possible to pull the problem apart into simpler sub-problems? 
7. Are there other approaches? What are all of the tradeoffs? Are they better in at least one way? 
8. What exactly makes something better or worse? How can we raise our preferences above the level of personal tastes to choices that have technical justification? 
9. Is this similar to other problems I've seen? Are there insights from these problems I can reuse, or reuse with modifications?
