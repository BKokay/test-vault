**Develop reasonable strategies**
Each distinct way of solving a problem is a strategy. Most problems have multiple strategies. After you develop a strategy, you should ask yourself if there are others. Ideally, you can identify the *entire* set of reasonable strategies. 

To think about the *best* strategy out of many, consider this: 
- A has advantage X and 0 weaknesses
- B has advantage X but 1 weakness
Even though B is as good as A when it comes to advantage X, B's weakness makes it an irrational choice. We can say it is *[[strictly worse]]* than A.
