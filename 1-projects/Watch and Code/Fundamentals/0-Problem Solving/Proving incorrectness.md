Find a counterexample aka. an input on which an algorithm fails to produce a correct result. After you find one, construct a logical argument for why the strategy is incorrect. Knowing what went wrong is often a first lead in the direction of a correct solution. 

Tips:
- Assume you are WRONG. Search like you already know you are wrong
- Simple and small counterexamples are best as they are easier to understand and find
- Test the full range of inputs (most likely to work to least likely to work).
