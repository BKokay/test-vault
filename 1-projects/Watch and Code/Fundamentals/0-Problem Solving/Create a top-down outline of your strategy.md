**Create a strategy based on your criteria**
Once you have your strategy floating around in your head, you have to now express the idea in writing. Working from abstract to concrete, broad to specific, vague to precise allows us to focus on the big parts of the problem first. *This is an unavoidable step if you want to be effective!!!*

By working top-down, we can refine our solution bit-by-bit, applying just enough pressure to move forward. Once we get the big pieces to fit together, we work out the next layer. "Push the big rocks before you kick around the pebbles."

In this step, it is important to extract a summary that captures our strategies main idea. It should help us differentiate our strategy against other possible strategies.
