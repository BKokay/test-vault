Problem Solving *is not* following recipes. It is not "plug and chug" and the author finds the fact that teachers even use that phrase depressing. If we are to be programmers we must **invent** the recipes for others to follow. 

The clear-eyes programmer understands that solving problems is a repeatable process that can be mastered. With each attempt, you pay close attention to what went well and what went poorly so that you can operate better next time. Each problem gives you the opportunity to make specific improvements so that *you* can produce better outcomes. 

# Steps to solve problems: 
1. [[Precisely define the problem]]
2. [[Develop reasonable strategies]]
3. [[Choose a strategy based on your criteria]]
4. [[Create a top-down outline of your strategy]]
5. [[Implementation]] 
6. [[Improve the machine]] 

These steps are practiced by the best in *every* field. They are known by many but practiced by few. 

# Correctness
[[Proving incorrectness]]
[[Proving correctness]]
	[[The "routinely wrong programmer"]]
	[[The "sometimes wrong programmer"]]
	[[The "rarely wrong programmer"]]
Tips on proving correctness:
- How does the strategy make progress towards the goal? 
- What guarantees are there? At each step? At the end? 

# [[Mental cues for solving problems]]

# [[Mental cues for outlines]]

Don't skip! You need to include at least on of these layers. For example, if you want to just include the broadest strokes, use d1 - like a summary. If you want to be exhaustive and work out finer details, you could include all layers. To make sure you don't skip from d2 to d4, always ask yourself "What is the broader goal" at every turn. If you ask yourself this at d2, you'll find d1. etc.
