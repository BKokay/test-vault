**Improve the machine**
Take stock - what helped or hindered your progress? 
For helpful things, could they have been accomplished more effectively or with less work? 
For hindrances, there are two questions. First, why did they even occur? For example, if you failed to consider something obvious, what was the likely cause of that blindness? Second, could the hindrances have been minimized or eliminated? Can we change our approach such that we _never_ have the same hindrance again? What is that specific change and how can we _reliably_ implement it in ourselves?
