1. Devise a strategy from the top-down.
2. As a starting point, assume the strategy is _wrong_. Hunt for counterexamples over _many_ inputs. Pay special attention to inputs that seem tricky or problematic.
3. If a counterexample is found, stop and write a proof of incorrectness.
4. If no issues were found in previous steps, declare the strategy correct.

“Sometimes wrong programmer” is a big improvement on “routinely wrong programmer”. They do their best, but are still wrong with alarming frequency. The most stressful part about being in this group is that you’re always worried that the next input will break your algorithm.
