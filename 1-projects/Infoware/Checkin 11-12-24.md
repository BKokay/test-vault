[[Initial Findings| Happy Trucker]] 
- Open questions about API usage - directly send to Happy Trucker?
- Flow for working with Oleksander on repo 
	- Make a feature branch
	- Pull directly from develop? There are a lot of open branches 
- API Documentation: any need for anything "developer relations" oriented? 
- [[Goals at infoware]] check out what still needs to be completed, or edit for new projects that I can work on to move towards Junior Dev 
	- Specializing in a language and framework 
		- Opinion needed: know a little about a lot or be really good at one thing? Where in my career is the right time to start thinking about this? 
	- Working on Vue with TypeScript over the next months. Will have a better idea of what I like after this next project as I have more experience and it will be less of a learning curve and more of a "what the work is actually like". 
	- Currently, enjoyed Java and thinking about systems and how they should interact (databases, api development, documentation)
