[[java error handling]] [[Basic Syntax of @ApiResponse]] [[HTTP Response]] 

This RFC obsoletes [[RFC 7807]]

response type is "application/problem+json" or "application/problem+xml"

`type`  URI with link to documentation. about:blank if no page
`status` HTTP status
`title` general information on error ie "Invalid Input Parameter"
`detail` details of specific error ie. "The coordinate must be in the format xx.xxxx, yy.yyyyy"
`instance` the specific request that failed
`code` could be added as an additional field to help with Client error handling

proactive negotiation - letting the server know ahead of time what the client wants to receive. If the client says "application/problem+json", we will serve this type. Otherwise, default to the current response. 

Titles should be:

- Short (generally under 50 characters)
- Reusable across similar errors
- Clear enough to understand the category of problem
- Written in present tense
- Consistent across your API

Details should be:

- Specific to this instance of the error
- Include relevant values or parameters
- Explain what went wrong in this particular case
- Potentially include suggestions for how to fix the problem
- Be complete sentences that make sense on their own
