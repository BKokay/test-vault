Georg changed caching to use just the user email rather than the whole token. He used the annotation `@Cacheable(value = CacheConfig.COMPANY_FOR_TOKEN, key = "T(de.infoware.maptripapi.util.TokenUtils).getUserName()")` This makes the key able to be a method rather than a hard-coded value. [[springboot]] so he can limit functionality by user rather than by company. 
Another interesting annotation was `@Scheduled(cron = "1 * * * * *")`. This made a scheduled chron job so that every day, or minute?, the method would run. In order to use the schedule, he had to add the annotation on his `SpringConfig` class:
```java
@Configuration
@EnableScheduling
public class SpringConfig... 
```

To enable caching, he needed this on his `CachingConfig` class:
```java
@Configuration
@EnableCaching
public class CacheConfig.. 
```
