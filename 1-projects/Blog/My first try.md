I have heard that writing helps you think. There is someone who said something to the effect of, ”I write, therefore I think.” 

As a mom, wife, apprentice, employee, household manager, etc., I have to confess that I don’t really do much thinking these days.

Learning, remembering what needs to be done, spending time with my family: yes. 

Mindlessly scrolling X, formerly Twitter, because sometimes adults just need a dopamine hit? Also, yes.  

Thinking deeply though? Or really, thinking about anything at all besides the aforementioned: not really. That isn’t a part of my routine right now. 

But, learning without thinking? that seems like a waste.

There is always this idea that I don’t have enough time, though. 

For sure, hours of uninterrupted free time is a rare occurrence in my life stage, but here I am in the bath, thinking a teeny tiny bit and writing it down in my teeny tiny pocket computer to hopefully put on my blog that I keep wanting to start. 

The problem is always the time, though. 

So, here’s what I’m going to try: 20 minutes a day. 

I watched a video from Gordon over at Watch and Code. I like that guy. He seems serious. Anyways, in the video, he talks about How to consistently get stuff done [[link]]. 

His advice wasn’t sexy and doesn’t even really require that difficult of commitment; it’s work on your goal for 20 minutes a day. That’s it. Doable, right? 

I’m going to try it. 20 minutes towards my goals a day. Let’s see if I can’t focus and reach a few. ADHD please allow.
