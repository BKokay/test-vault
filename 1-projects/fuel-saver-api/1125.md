- [x] Read notes from Georg [[API Codes RFC edit]] and understand what will be needed for the Server API to be able to implement that 
- [ ] catch the `HttpMediaTypeNotSupportedException` to return a 400 instead of 500 error 
	- [ ] [`415 Unsupported Media Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/415)
Okay, noted. I am working on something for Georg now. The three things I need to update on the API are: add the timestamp automatically, update the enum for fueltype, and update the entity response if there is a user error `415 Unsupported Media Type`.  Also need to check the request for lat/lon and translate to latitude/longitude for db. Gas Station name could be null. 
Enum values - convert all to uppercase for my app.
