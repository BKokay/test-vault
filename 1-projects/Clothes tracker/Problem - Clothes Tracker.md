# Problem statements

As a mom, I have to keep a lot of information in my head. This is also known as the 'mental load' that typically women carry. One of the things I have to do on a quarterly basis is to keep inventory of my children's clothing. What sizes do they have? What seasons are those clothes for? What might they need in the next season that I can buy now? When I am having a second child, what do I have from the first child that I can use with the second ? 

These questions take up a lot of mental space and require a lot of planning, organization, and executive function.
