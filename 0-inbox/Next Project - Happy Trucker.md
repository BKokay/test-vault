Ask Georg what he thinks of HappyTrucker integration being added as a feature in the maptrip maps app. Would be: 
Calling their api to get info about truck stops
Doing a radius search to pad out api response with data about restaurants etc
Would be working on the app in Vue and collaborating with Alexander to get better acquainted with workings of the code. 

Why? Because the fuelsaver feature might have some blockers on it (token, driver) which needs to be worked out on the app team before I start working on the fuel saver feature for maptrip maps. Would also help me to get back into Vue while waiting on the integration with maptrip to be ready.
