- [x] ApiExceptionHandler 
	- [x] What to do with method `handleApi()`? It is type of `MapTripServerApiRequestException` but need to be `MapTripServerApiError` to use the `handleApiErrorResponse()`
	- [x] What to do with method `handleConstraintViolation()`? The `GeneralErrors.INVALID_PARAMETER` requires two variables - `parameter` & `violation`. 
- [ ] `UriConverterUtils` needs to lead to an html page with error - how can I set that up? 
- [ ] On all specification pages, add a header to accept `application/json, application/problem+json`. Look at the route.yml and the provider spec to see examples and reuse in all endpoints
- [ ] --header 'Accept: application/json, application/problem+json'

Issue with `MapTripsSeverApiRequestException`:
- in this class, we super the title from `MapTripServerApiError`. In some cases, that is fine, but in others, it has become a shortened message. We actually want the details in some cases. 
- In the `ApiExceptionHandler.handleApi()` the exception is being converted into a `MapTripServerApiError` using `ErrorUtils.getMapTripServerApiError`. 
- What I'd like to do is to use the details in the `MapTripServerApiRequestException`, but for some of the `MapTripServerApiErrors`, that would be null. I could possibly add another field to `MapTripServerApiRequestException` with the details. 
- add details field in excception and anywhere exception.getmessage() is used in tests, use details instead if
