2. Print and complete.
3. Return oath with your Ballot.

Return ballot in one envelope with Official Absentee Ballot written on the outside and seal. Place ballot envelope and oath inside larger envelope and seal.  You must return your oath for your ballot to be counted.

**Print and return your ballot**

Pack your ballot and oath of elector to return to the elections office. Print one copy of your ballot page(s). Do not return multiple pages of the same voted contest(s). You or your mother, father, grandparent, aunt, uncle, sister, brother, spouse, son, daughter, niece, nephew, grandchild, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or an individual residing in your household shall personally mail or deliver your ballot to your county elections office, O.C.G.A § 21-2-385(a)

**Seal your oath and ballot in a plain envelope**

Write the words “Official Absentee Ballot” on the inner envelope and enclose your ballot and seal. Fold your oath of elector and place your oath and sealed ballot in the outer envelope. The oath should not go into the same envelope as your sealed ballot to ensure voter privacy when processing your ballot oath. The size of the envelope does not matter.

**Seal and return your ballot**

Your ballot can only be mailed or delivered to the election’s office by yourself or your mother, father, grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother, sister, spouse, son, daughter, niece, nephew, grandchild, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in law, sister-in-law, or an individual living in your same household.

Be sure to include sufficient postage. Mail your ballot so that it is postmarked by the date of the primary, election, or runoff and received within three days of the primary, election, or runoff to be counted. The return address for your County Elections Office was provided to you in the initial ballot email. 

**Deliver it**

You can deliver your ballot in person to your U.S. Embassy or Consulate to be transmitted via diplomatic pouch, but your ballot must be received by your County Elections Office by 7:00 p.m. on Election Day to be counted.
