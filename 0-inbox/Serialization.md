# What is serialization?
*Serialization* is converting a Java object into a formal (like JSON or XML) that can be easily stored or transmitted.
*Deserialization* is taking that formatted data and converting it back into a Java object.

## Metaphor
Imagine you have a recipe card (Java Object) and you want to send it to a friend who lives far away: 
*Serialization*: To send the recipe, you can't just hand them the ingredients directly; instead, you need to write down the recipe on a piece of paper (JSON or XML). Serialization is like writing down all the details of your recipe in a format that can be easily sent through the mail.
*Deserialization*: When your friend receives the recipe card, they need to understand it to make the dish. Deserialization is like reading the recipe card and reconstructing the dish step-by-step from the written instructions.
