- [x] pull develop
- [x] build
- [x] branch
- [x] add spec for ProblemDetail
- [x] add to responses
- [x] build
- [x] see if it is in swagger UI
- [x] now check the accept header in ApiExceptionHandler 
- [x] if problem+json, return ProblemDetails class
- [x] Write tests
- [x] Next step: converter 
- [x]  on general errors - for ones that start with error, the first part of URI should be general - do a check in the convertor `ERROR_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION`  -> `/general/constraint-violation`
- [ ] Look at handleConstraintViolation in ApiExceptionHandler - dont implement now, just test MapTripServerApiError - when that works then implent constraint. 
- [x] Just pass MapTripServerApiError - not ApiError on all handleApiErrorResponses 
- [ ] in specfication - add header to accept application/json, application/probomm+json - look at route spec to see example. Look at provider spec and reuse in all endpoints


NEW BRANCH! with INWA-4784. First pull from develop, build, then new branch 
new converter class which takes code and creates URI and set URI to code 
Start with specificiation part - add schema and then will generate code and can use in ApiExceptionHandler `ProblemDetail` 
accept header to define which of the classes should be returned

clean package - run as map-trip
[[New Error Codes Server Api]]

`handleErrorResponse` originally just takes in an `apiError`. 
`MapTripServerApiError` -> String code, String title, HttpStatus httpStatus || String code, String title, HttpStatus httpStatus, String details
`ApiError` -> int status, List<String> errors, List<ApiErrorDetail> details



`ApiProblemDetail` -> int status, URI/String type, String title (is detail), String detail (optional), String timestamp, URI/String instance
