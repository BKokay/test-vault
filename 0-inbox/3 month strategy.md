Starting December 16, 2024
Structure / Process
- every day blocked into 90 minute sessions followed by 10 minute reflection breaks. 
- Before each session, sketch out/map out what I will build (already in Jira, but write exact todos) 
- during the reflection time, document any patterns I found
- Always document any bugs or issue as to what they were and how I solved them
- Keep a “pattern journal” for any recurring patterns or solutions I see
Practice
- build a small application or part of an application each week. 
- Time myself on common tasks to see improvement 
- If there is something I use often, try to recreate the solution in my own words 


Let me focus on your most aligned strategies for this specific phase, based on your chart:

Three Key Development Strategies:

1. Structure (Virgo Midheaven + Saturn in 1st):
- Block your day into focused 90-minute coding sessions
- Create a detailed learning log documenting bugs you solve and patterns you discover
- Pick ONE language/framework to master before branching out

2. Process (Mercury in Cancer + Pisces IC):
- Start each coding session by sketching/mapping what you'll build
- Take 10-minute reflection breaks between coding sessions to integrate what you've learned
- Keep a "pattern journal" where you note recurring solutions you discover

3. Practice (North Node in Aries + Jupiter in Aries):
- Build one small project completely from scratch each week
- Time yourself on common tasks to track improvement
- Recreate existing code from scratch to understand it deeply

Focus on these practices consistently for the next 3 months before adding anything else. Your chart suggests mastery comes through thorough understanding rather than rushing forward.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
