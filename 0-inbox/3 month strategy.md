Starting December 16, 2024
Structure / Process
- every day blocked into 90 minute sessions followed by 10 minute reflection breaks. 
- Before each session, sketch out/map out what I will build (already in Jira, but write exact todos) 
- during the reflection time, document any patterns I found
- Always document any bugs or issue as to what they were and how I solved them
- Keep a “pattern journal” for any recurring patterns or solutions I see
Practice
- build a small application or part of an application each week. 
- Time myself on common tasks to see improvement 
- If there is something I use often, try to recreate the solution in my own words 
- Try to implement one small micro-feature per session 


Let me focus on your most aligned strategies for this specific phase, based on your chart:

Three Key Development Strategies:

1. Structure (Virgo Midheaven + Saturn in 1st):
- Block your day into focused 90-minute coding sessions
- Create a detailed learning log documenting bugs you solve and patterns you discover
- Pick ONE language/framework to master before branching out

2. Process (Mercury in Cancer + Pisces IC):
- Start each coding session by sketching/mapping what you'll build
- Take 10-minute reflection breaks between coding sessions to integrate what you've learned
- Keep a "pattern journal" where you note recurring solutions you discover
- Always leave myself a “next steps” note 

3. Practice (North Node in Aries + Jupiter in Aries):
Ah, let me refine the practice strategy for your limited time, especially considering your Saturn in Sagittarius (structured efficiency) and Jupiter in Aries (making the most of short bursts):

Revised Practice Strategy for 1 Hour/Day:

1. Weekly Structure (Virgo Midheaven):
- Monday-Thursday: 1-hour focused practice on your current work stack
- Friday-Sunday: Alternate between:
  * Code review and pattern documentation
  * Small project work (breaking one project into 3-day chunks)
  * Studying solutions you wrote earlier to internalize patterns

2. Project Approach (Jupiter in Aries + Saturn):
- Break projects into 15-minute achievable segments
- Focus on one micro-feature per day
- Keep a "next steps" note so you can quickly resume where you left off
- Set a 3-week limit on any single project

3. Progress Tracking (Mercury in Cancer):
- Keep a 5-minute daily log of what clicked/what didn't
- Notice which times of day you learn best
- Track which concepts need more attention
- Note patterns that become intuitive

Remember: Your North Node in Aries suggests that small, bold steps forward are better than perfect execution. Trust that consistency in small chunks will build to mastery.

Would you like specific examples of micro-projects that can fit into this schedule?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Focus on these practices consistently for the next 3 months before adding anything else. Your chart suggests mastery comes through thorough understanding rather than rushing Forward. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
