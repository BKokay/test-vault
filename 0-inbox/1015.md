- [x] correct watch and code homework gist
- [x] Gas station tests 
- [x] Re run test suite
- [x] fix github vault issue 
	- [x] The issue is that all of my files are in the Windows environment. So my ssh and known_hosts from VSCode and PowerShell are trying to be in `C:\Users\Keith\.ssh`. But, I have my ssh keys and config in `/home/keith/.ssh`. Even when I remove the file from the `Users` dir, it gets rewritten. 
	- [x] I need to move everything around (the housekeeping I've been putting off), and just run Ubuntu on my local machine rather than Windows. Ask Georg what he thinks. 
	- [x] finally just added the reg ssh key rather than personal and works
- [ ] chage test db to h2 database or other https://www.baeldung.com/java-in-memory-databases
	- [ ] for now, add tag "integration" and exclude from ci
	- [ ] `@Tag("integration")`

```yml
