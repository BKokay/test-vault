A tracker that second time around moms can take inventory of what they already have for baby number two and easily access that information from a web app 

Will have three views: 
1. a landing page where you can play with the tracker to show on my portfolio as well as to my family as a baby announcement.
2. Behind a sign in wall, users can track their own information 
3. Behind a sign in wall, users can download a file with their information
