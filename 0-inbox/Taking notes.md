Make my note atomic, make it search friendly

[[what is an atomic note?]]

[[atomic notes]] - each idea should be as small as possible and fit on a notecard 
- questions
- ideas 
- supplementary tools
[[tags]] used to help you find your ideas quickly 
- build - she used this if she wanted to build something 
- check - if she's in a hurry and just wanted to quickly write down a thought 
- toread
- towatch

make sure that the title is easily searchable and use keywords that will allow you to use ctrl + f to find what you need. The idea is not to make a bunch of random notes but to start to build upon your ideas.
