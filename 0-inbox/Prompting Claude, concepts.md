To learn new concepts in a new language, create a new project which follows the familiar folder structure of a real project:
```
JavaLearningProject/
│
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   └── java/
│   │       ├── concepts/
│   │       │   ├── StreamAPI.java
│   │       │   ├── Lambdas.java
│   │       │   ├── OptionalClass.java
│   │       │   └── ... (other concept files)
│   │       │
│   │       └── examples/
│   │           ├── StreamAPIExamples.java
│   │           ├── LambdaExamples.java
│   │           ├── OptionalExamples.java
│   │           └── ... (other example files)
│   │
│   └── test/
│       └── java/
│           └── concepts/
│               ├── StreamAPITest.java
│               ├── LambdasTest.java
│               ├── OptionalClassTest.java
│               └── ... (other test files)
│
└── README.md
```

Then whenever you're asking about a new concept, use this template: 
```
I'm learning about [Concept Name] in Java. As an experienced developer teaching a beginner with some programming background:

1. Concept Overview:
   - Provide a brief explanation of [Concept Name].
   - How does it compare to similar concepts in JavaScript or TypeScript?

2. Key Features and Use Cases:
   - List and briefly explain 3-5 key features or methods of [Concept Name].
   - Provide 2-3 common use cases where this concept is particularly useful.

3. Code Example:
   - Show a basic implementation of [Concept Name] (5-10 lines of code).
   - Then, provide a more advanced example (10-20 lines) that demonstrates its power and flexibility.

4. Best Practices and Gotchas:
   - What are 2-3 best practices when using [Concept Name]?
   - Are there any common mistakes or misconceptions to avoid?

5. Performance Considerations:
   - Are there any performance implications to be aware of?
   - How does it compare to alternative approaches?

6. Testing:
   - Provide a simple unit test example for the basic implementation above.

7. Further Learning:
   - Suggest 2-3 related Java concepts I should explore next.
   - Recommend any specific resources (documentation, tutorials, books) for deeper learning.

Please structure your response with clear headings and code blocks where appropriate.
