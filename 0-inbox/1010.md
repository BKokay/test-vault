~~/api/gasstation/all~~

~~all lowercase~~ 

~~/api/gasstation/{id} remove delete save update~~ 

~~tag to rename controllers~~
```java
@Tag(name = "geocoder", description = "Find coordinates for a location, or locations for a coordinate")
```

~~/getdriver -> driver~~

coordinate class as component lat/lon are the only attributes and have getters and setters (separate object )

**Had to change Update and Delete methods to accept Long or Id**
**Changed save method to return a generic** 

- this will require that I parse the coordinate differently. Here are two options:
##### Option 1 : Use SQL Aliases to Retrieve Components Directly
```sql
SELECT id, street, street_number, zip_code, city, country_code, station_name, 
       location.latitude AS latitude, location.longitude AS longitude
FROM gas_station
WHERE id = ?;
```
```java
// Assuming 'rs' is your ResultSet
double latitude = rs.getDouble("latitude");
double longitude = rs.getDouble("longitude");
```

##### Option 2: Retrieve the Composite Type as a String and Parse It
```sql
SELECT id, street, street_number, zip_code, city, country_code, station_name, 
       location
FROM gas_station
WHERE id = ?;
```
```java
// Assuming 'rs' is your ResultSet
String location = rs.getString("location");
location = location.replace("(", "").replace(")", "");  // Clean up parentheses
String[] coordinates = location.split(",");

// Parse latitude and longitude
double latitude = Double.parseDouble(coordinates[0]);
double longitude = Double.parseDouble(coordinates[1]);

```

change fuel_stop.stationId  -> gasStationId 

mapTripManagerCompany  - ID

Device ID - will be from Maptrip manager . Needs to be visible, remove auto generate and just use the one from maptrip manager which is a string hwid 

~~All ids should be visble~~ 

GasStations can be imported the application that Olga made with a list of the stations so shape of object could change OR by maptrip. 
Do the gastations already have an ID in maptrip? Replace the autogenerated ID with the id we already have in maptrip. What do the ids look like? Ask Tsotne or Daniel. 

```json
{
  "deviceId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", //from maptrip
  "stationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", //from maptrip **clarify name
  "stopTimestamp": "2024-10-10T08:24:07.738Z",
  "pricePerLiter": 1.47,
  "numberOfLiters": 20,
  "totalSavings": 2.64,
  "fuelType": "PETROL"
}
```

.jar file - ? set this so it can run on a server. 
Set up database on machine - need to have database schema clean via above questions 
deploy to machine with jar or war 

clever tanken IDs - long 6 characters 
check if there, 

10/11 
- [ ] change gasstationid to a long 6
- [ ] change device id to a string in device and fuel stop
- [ ] change maptripmanagerid to string in driver 
- [ ] implement coordinate instead of lat/lon in gas station 
- [ ] change name in fuel stop to gasStationId
- [ ] currently changing stationId to gasStationId and other changes related to that. 
	- [ ] changed in DBsetup, GasStation, FuelStop
	- [ ] Would there be a case where the object id would need to be null, and go back and set it after creation? 
I started changing coordinates, but stopped halfway through. Need to go back to that and not forget.
Each change in steps!
