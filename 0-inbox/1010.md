~~tag to rename controllers~~
```java
@Tag(name = "geocoder", description = "Find coordinates for a location, or locations for a coordinate")
```

~~/getdriver -> driver~~

coordinate class as component lat/lon are the only attributes and have getters and setters (separate object )

mapTripManagerCompany 

Device ID - will be from Maptrip manager . Needs to be visible, remove auto generate and just use the one from maptrip manager which is a string 

~~All ids should be visble~~ 

GasStations can be imported the application that Olga made with a list of the stations so shape of object could change OR by maptrip. 
Do the gastations already have an ID in maptrip? Replace the autogenerated ID with the id we already have in maptrip. What do the ids look like? Ask Tsotne or Daniel.
