##### 11.11
Can I test the controllers with my fake postgres db that I have setup? Yes... how? 

##### 11.12
- [ ] Add more methods to device controller and other layers as  in [[Fuel Saver Meeting 1111 notes]]
	- [x] see what I did with the timestamp in the FuelStop entity and controller/dao 
		- [x] The issue was with the db dump and it not setting up the tables in an order that allowed dependencies to be created. Changed DB setup to be hard coded rather than from the dump
- [ ] Figure out why localhost:8080 isn't working: was calling prod server rather than localhost endpoint. Had to add server.url to application-dev.properties/application.properties and then in the SwaggerConfig, point the server to whichever environment 
```java
@Value("${server.url}")
private String serverUrl;

@Bean
public OpenAPI customOpenAPI() {
Server server = new Server().url(serverUrl).description("API Server");
```

- [ ] HomeController no longer redirects to /swagger-ui/index.html
