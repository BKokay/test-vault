- [ ] check all save methods in swagger 
- [x] Finish gas station refactor - ended on controller 
- [ ] Click all methods in swagger to see if they work as expected. 
- [ ] fix "database not connected" to be just database error 
- [ ] Remove responseCodes class and just use response entities 
- [ ] Does it make sense to have camel case in the objects and then need it to be underscore_case in the put and save methods? The issue is with the UpdateUtil method

Currently testing with all default values. Next, test with good data.
