- [x] fix "database not connected" to be just database error 
- [ ] ~~Remove responseCodes class and just use response entities~~ 
- [ ] Does it make sense to have camel case in the objects and then need it to be underscore_case in the put and save methods? The issue is with the UpdateUtil method

Issue with server: when I try to delete a device which I know exists, I get an unexpected error. On my local environment, it works as expected. But in production, it is not working. The issue is that I cannot see the logs for some reason. I get a hanging cursor.
