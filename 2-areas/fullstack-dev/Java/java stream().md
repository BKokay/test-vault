[[stream java method]]
An API which allows us to perform a set of functions on certain data structures. Allows us to process collections of objects without changing their original data structure. They only provide a result as per the [[pipeline operations]]. They have [[lazy evaluation]] and [[parallel execution]]. Common use cases: *Data transformation, Filtering, Aggregation*

[[Intermediate operations]] are methods which change the data and can be chained in a row. For example, filter then sort.
