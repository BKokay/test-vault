**Getters** are like a waitstaff at a restaurant. They bring you information from the kitchen, but you can't directly access the kitchen itself. In programming, they return the value of a variable without you accessing the private data itself. 
**Setters** are like the waitstaff taking your order and passing it to the kitchen. They take your request and ensure it is communicated to the chef. In programming, they take your value you want to assign to a variable and communicate it to the program's [[internal state]].
