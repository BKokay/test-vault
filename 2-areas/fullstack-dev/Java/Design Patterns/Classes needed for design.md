### Classes needed for one table `User`
1. [[User Entity class | Entity class]]  `User`
2. [[User DAO interface | DAO interface]] `UserDao`
3. [[User DAO implementation class | DAO Implementation Class]] `UserDaoImpl`
4. [[User Service Class | Service Class]] `UserService`
5. [[User Main Class | Main Class]] `Main`

#### How It All Fits Together

1. **Entity Class (`User`)**: Represents the structure of data in the database. Each instance corresponds to a row in the `users` table.
    
2. **DAO Interface (`UserDAO`)**: Defines the operations that can be performed on the `User` entity, such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting users.
    
3. **DAO Implementation (`UserDAOImpl`)**: Contains the actual JDBC code to interact with the database. It translates the method calls into SQL queries and handles the database connection.
    
4. **Service Layer (`UserService`)**: Contains business logic and calls the DAO to perform operations. It acts as an intermediary between the DAO and the application logic.
    
5. **Client Code**: Interacts with the service layer to perform operations on the `User` entity. This could be part of a controller in a web application or a main class in a desktop application.
