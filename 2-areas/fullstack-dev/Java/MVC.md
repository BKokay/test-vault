What is an MVC? It stands for *Model-View-Controller*, a design pattern used in software development to separate concerns within an application, particularly for building use interfaces, web applications, and APIs. 

The *Controller* gets requests from the client. It asks the *Model* for information about the data then sends the data to the *View* which renders HTML or whatever format. The view then sends information back to the controller which renders it to the client.
