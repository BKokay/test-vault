The part of the software program responsible for implementing the business rules that define how data should be created, modified, transformed, communicated and in other ways managed and controlled. 

Like a chef - just as a chef decides how a dish should be prepared, how ingredients are combined, and how it should taste, business logic dictates how data is processed, what decisions are made, and how an application should behave to meet the specific goals of the business. It is the part of the program that ensures everything is done according to the rules and requirements - just like a chef ensures every dish meets the restaurant's standards before it's served to customers. 

It is a compiled, broader set of [[business rules]] that are followed and applied in the right context.  Will make a cohesive experience.
