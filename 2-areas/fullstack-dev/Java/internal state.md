A programs **internal state** is the combination of all the data and variables that define the current situation of an object or program. It is the 'memory' of the object or program at any given moment. In restaurant terms, it is like the behind the scene status of the restaurant's kitchen - what ingredients are on hand, what dishes are currently being prepared, the overall readiness to serve.
