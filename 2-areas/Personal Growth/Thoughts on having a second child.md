My daughter would have someone in this life. Especially after we pass, and as we age. 

I won’t be alone when I die (hopefully).

Our family will have one more member. 

It’ll be a few years of growing pains before we have a full table and even fuller hearts.

It would be the right time to do it, while we have paid parental leave. 

Lili will be a very happy and helpful big sister. 

————————————-

I would have to go through the depression after having a baby (baby blues).

It would be a very difficult thing to do while here, without family. 

We’d struggle. Emotionally, with finding our new routine, with managing it all.
