Ifs mediation on my heart. I feel like my heart is very protected because it is so so sensitive. It feels like it should be incredibly tender but Iâ€™ve learned to harden my heart so that I can fit in. I was always thought to be so weird. And I always felt so strongly in my heart space. Even just giving my heart attention brought up sensations in my body and tears came. There might be something there.
