last night, I was in the bath and kept having this thought run through my head - *"it never gets easier, you just get fitter."* 

This was a response to Kayla Itsnes post that said, "What is one thing you wish more people knew about working out?" 

This idea is true about everything - eating smaller portions regularly, studying with consistency, getting better at solving programming challenges. It doesn't get easier, you just get better at it as you solidify the habit. 

I had the strong realization that I have been slipping further and further away from the woman I was so proud of becoming. I am no longer waking early to meditate. I am no longer making sure I move at least 20 minutes a day. I am no longer reading at night. I am no longer tracking my spending. 

When thinking about what I was doing when I felt, "on top of the world", it was bullet journaling for habits I wanted to build. It was right after reading [[Atomic Habits]] by [[James Clear]] and the thing that I implemented the best was the bullet journaling. 

With this in mind, I am going to start bullet journaling again. I am going to start small with just one habit stack I want to build, or maybe with just one habit from each section I want to build. I think maybe the first two weeks, I should just do habits that I know I can do or something. Hmm... let's brain storm
- [ ] fast for the weekdays until 12 (hard!!!!) and after 7. 
- [ ] Take smaller portions. 
- [ ] Stop eating before you think you're full
- [ ] Meditate 4 days out of the week
- [ ] Go to bed by 10
- [ ] Get up by 6
- [ ] Read 1 page a night
- [ ] Work out 20 minutes every day
- [ ] Do the Java mooc for 30 minutes a day
- [ ] Do one codewars M-F
- [ ] Meal prep 2 salads, 2 mains, 5 lunches on Sundays
