Founder is Steve March. He started as a coach and tried out many different modalities. He saw that most modalities, worked even though rheu were vastly different. They all worked but at different depths. 

Model of four depths: 
[[Parts]]
Process 
Presence and absence 
[[Nonduality]] feeling of interconnectedness with everyone and everything around you. A way of living in buddhism.  

Clients could spontaneously shift up and down through the different depths within a single coaching session.
